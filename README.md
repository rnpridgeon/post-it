# Post-It  

Post-It is a "Hello World" type application which was used to familiarize myself with [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) , [Tailwind CSS](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/) and [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

## Deploy both front end and back-end services using docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Run backend integration tests 

```
    cd rust
    cargo test
```
